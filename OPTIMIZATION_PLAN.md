# Optimization Plan

This document outlines the optimization strategies for improving data fetching, caching, and rendering behavior across the Bonas Marketplace application.

## 1. Homepage Fixes

### Server-Side Rendering
- Ensure all data fetched on the homepage is server-rendered using Next.js Server Components
- Convert client components to server components where possible for initial data loading
- Implement proper error boundaries to handle server-side data fetching failures

### Router Prefetching
- Enable Next.js router prefetching for all navigation links pointing to the homepage
- Implement `router.prefetch('/')` in components that frequently navigate to the homepage
- Add appropriate loading states during prefetch transitions

### Caching Strategy
- Implement React Query or SWR for client-side caching of homepage data
- Configure cache invalidation strategies to refresh data in the background
- Set appropriate cache TTL values based on data volatility

## 2. Search Page Fixes

### Server-Side Data Fetching
- Move critical data fetching (categories, top filters) to server-side functions
- Use Next.js API routes or server actions for data retrieval
- Implement proper error handling for server-side data fetching

### Parallel Data Fetching
- Refactor data fetching to use `Promise.all()` for concurrent requests
- Identify and eliminate sequential data fetching patterns
- Implement proper loading states for each data dependency

### Progressive Rendering
- Maintain skeleton loaders for progressive rendering of search results
- Implement placeholder components for better perceived performance
- Ensure skeleton loaders match the final layout dimensions

## 3. Listing Detail Page Fixes (/listing/[id])

### Server-Side Loading
- Load main listing details using server-side rendering
- Implement proper error handling for missing or invalid listing IDs
- Use Next.js dynamic rendering for personalized content

### Parallel Data Fetching
- Fetch related listings and reviews concurrently using Promise.all()
- Show placeholder components while waiting for secondary data
- Implement proper loading states for each section

### Repository Optimization
- Combine redundant queries in listing repositories
- Push filtering and sorting logic to database queries where possible
- Optimize database queries with appropriate WHERE clauses and JOINs

## 4. Repository Improvements

### Query Consolidation
- Identify and merge repetitive queries across repositories
- Create composite queries that fetch multiple related data sets
- Eliminate N+1 query problems in data fetching patterns

### Database-Level Logic
- Move randomization logic to database queries using `ORDER BY RANDOM()`
- Implement trending algorithms at the database level using views or stored procedures
- Use database functions for complex calculations instead of application code

### Indexing Strategy
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns:
  - Categories table: parent_id, slug
  - Locations table: parent_id, slug
  - Listings table: category_id, location_id, created_at, is_trending
- Implement composite indexes for common query patterns
- Monitor query performance and adjust indexing strategy accordingly

## 5. Navigation & Caching Strategy

### Next.js Caching
- Implement appropriate caching strategies:
  - `cache: 'force-cache'` for static data that changes infrequently
  - `cache: 'no-store'` for dynamic data that should never be cached
  - Time-based revalidation using `next.revalidate`
- Configure fetch cache options for different data types

### Suspense Boundaries
- Implement React Suspense boundaries for all data-fetching components
- Create consistent placeholder components for loading states
- Use Suspense for both server and client components

### Data Reuse Strategy
- Configure caching to show stale data immediately while refreshing in background
- Implement proper cache invalidation after data mutations
- Use optimistic updates for better user experience during data mutations

## General Rules

- Do not change any UI design or layout
- Focus only on data-fetching, caching, and rendering behavior optimizations
- Maintain existing user experience while improving performance
- Ensure all optimizations are backward compatible
- Test all changes thoroughly to avoid regressions
